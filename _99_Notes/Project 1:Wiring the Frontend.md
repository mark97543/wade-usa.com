### **Project #1: The Initial Spark - Wiring the Frontend**

- **The Mission:** Our first major quest was to make the `shell` application, our empty house, actually show something from our `home` feature package. We needed to prove that our monorepo packages could talk to each other.
    
- **The Adventure (The "Why"):** We hit our first snag when the `shell` app threw an error, claiming it couldn't find `@wade-usa/feature-home`. It was like sending a letter to an address the post office didn't know existed. The `shell` app knew it needed the `home` package, but it hadn't been formally introduced.
    
- **The Solution (The "How"):**
    
    1.  We played matchmaker by officially adding `"@wade-usa/feature-home": "workspace:*"` to the dependencies in `apps/shell/package.json`.
        
    2.  We then updated the `shell`'s main component, `apps/shell/src/App.jsx`, to import and use the `HomePage` component and wrapped it in a `<Router>` to handle all the page navigation.
