### **Project #3: The Case of the Invisible Videos**

- **The Mission:** With the homepage loading, we faced a new mystery: our videos, hosted on DigitalOcean Spaces, were invisible! The page was there, but the content was playing hide-and-seek.
    
- **The Adventure (The "Why"):** This was a two-part problem. First, Directus, our security-conscious CMS, was uploading the files to DigitalOcean Spaces but marking them as `private`. Second, even when we tried to fix it, we were using the wrong "secret code" (environment variable) to tell Directus to make them public by default.
    
- **The Solution (The "How"):**
    
    1.  We first logged into Directus and changed the **Roles & Permissions** for the **Public** role, granting it `Read` access to the `directus_files` collection.
        
    2.  You astutely pointed out that the generic `STORAGE_S3_ACL` environment variable was incorrect. We corrected it to the provider-specific `STORAGE_DIGITALOCEAN_ACL="public-read"` in our `.env` file.
        
    3.  Finally, we applied this change by restarting our services with the modern `docker compose down` and `docker compose up -d` commands.
