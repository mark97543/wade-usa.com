# SERVER BLOCK FOR THE FRONTEND REACT APP (wade-usa.com)
# ===============================================================

# This server block handles insecure HTTP traffic on port 80 for the main website.
# It is used for the initial Certbot challenge and to redirect users to HTTPS.
server {

    # --- THE CRUCIAL FIX IS HERE ---
    # This location block specifically handles the Let's Encrypt challenge requests.
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        # By setting the root here, we tell Nginx to look in the correct
        # shared directory for the challenge files, solving the 404 error.
        root /var/www/certbot;
    }

    # For all other HTTP requests, we will redirect them to the secure HTTPS site.
    # We will add this redirect after we successfully obtain the certificate.
    # For now, we only need to handle the certbot challenge.
